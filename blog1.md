# Operation Vesper Loom

Hello there. I am an independent musician known as Tail Glow. This blog post will lay out the goals and strategy for my musical endeavours throughout the first half of 2025, which I will encapsulate with the colorful name "Operation Vesper Loom".

I have been primarily operating out of the city Augusta, Georgia for the past few years and have spent a lot of time steadily doing research and learning about the music scene here. I have to say I see a lot of potential in many of the musicians, music fans, and venue staff / promoters here, but after taking enough time to refine and solidify my goals as an artist, I believe now is the time to take action to steer the live music scene in a direction that I hope to be even more exciting and creatively prosperous.

## Overview / Goals

The simplest description of "Operation Vesper Loom" I can give is to book a series of shows I will perform at, one per month, at a selection of different venues, each with a different line up of supporting artists, but it goes a little deeper than that. The selection of artists that I'm looking at is intentionally designed to be as diverse as possible in terms of influence and potential audience, so I want to be up front about that with any of the artists I'll be contacting.

I'm also going to make it explicitly clear that these events are part of a particular series and promotional strategy and will openly use the "Operation Vesper Loom" name for branding in all promotional materials. I will also be publicizing this blog post, either by passing out cards with a URL or even printed hard copies of this very text you are reading right now, or at least certain sections of it, at various open mics or other incidental performances I may be asked to do during this period.

As far as what to expect from "Tail Glow" in particular: I am going to make every show a unique experience in terms of what material I play and how it is implemented at that particular venue. That's all I can reveal for now, other than the fact that if you have seen me perform before and enjoyed what you saw, this will be just like that only way better. I often try to avoid sounding conceited but I can assure you: I have been cooking.

## Why Free Shows?

I want to ensure that any shows under the Operation Vesper Loom branding are free for anyone to attend. I would prefer they be all ages as well, but that is not very feasible given the nature of most music venues here. (There may be a "Phase II" in the future that more specifically addresses this issue.)

I do want to comment on the nature of free shows for a second, as controversy sometimes exists around the idea of "flooding the market" with free shows. I believe musicians should be compensated much better than they currently are, but I also have to be honest about the amount of "draw" that I can generate, even with the help of the other talented artists I'll be collaborating with. I also really firmly believe that to sustain an artistic community there needs to be some baseline of activity happening on a regular basis with a low barrier to entry. Many artists forget that "draw" is not simply a function of how "good" you are as an artist, the other important factor is the market you are serving and how people's awareness and habits lead to more or less demand to see live music in the first place.

Happily, many of the venues I've worked with in Augusta are very amenable to sharing some portion of sales or making some effort to compensate the artists that perform at their venues. Much moreso than I would've expected based on some of my past experiences so that is an encouraging sign. I can't necessarily guarantee that every venue I work with will be able to guarantee compensation to all of the other artists, but I will work to make this happen if possible. What I can guarantee is that *none* of the money that I receive in compensation will be kept by me. All of it will be redistributed to the other artists or any guest musicians that I hire.

In fact, I want to be quite upfront that some of the promotional strategies I'm considering could be considered "brazen" by some observers. Let's talk about one idea, which I'm calling "Show Payola."

## Show Payola

I considered using the term "Showola" but as "Payola" is already a compound word so the association gets somewhat lost. Maybe "Payshowla" is better? Sounds too awkward to me though.

If you're unaware, the term "Payola" was coined in reference to a scandal whereby record labels would use kickbacks to ensure preferential treatment for certain DJs on radio stations in certain markets. The concept of "Show Payola" is to give "kickbacks" to the people who make an effort to attend these shows and support live music in their city. Or to put it in less flattering terms: it's bribing people to go to shows.

The exact implementation of this strategy is still to be determined, so I'll go over my general ideas for now.

### Option 1: The Raffle System

This option would entail having small number of prizes that would be randomly given to a handful of winners chosen by a "raffle" system they can enter at the show. Entering this system would only involve submitting your name to the list, there will not be a "purchase price" for entrance, just like there will not be a cover charge necessary to enter the shows.

### Option 2: Extracurricular Challenges

This option would entail having some kind of special "competition" such as a dance off, talent show, costume contest, etc. and using that to determine who gets a prize.

### Possible Prizes

I'm not above literally just giving a small cash reward as a prize, but that idea is probably the least "fun" or "creative" and is the most likely to have some obscure legal ramification that I haven't thought of yet. I've also considered "gift cards" as a workaround but I'll be blunt that promoting consumerism is not generally something I want to be associated with my art, although gift cards to help support local businesses provide useful services to other artists or musicians is an idea I'm amenable to. I'd also consider making charitable donations in the winner's name as a prize.

In actuality though, the most likely type of prize that I am gravitating towards is original art pieces. That way I can make these prizes much more economically efficiently and incorporate "Operation Vesper Loom" branding as well to help raise awareness and continue to promote the overall goals of this project.

## For Guest Musicians I've Contacted

I've reached out across a few internet "platforms" to inquire about musicians who play instruments "other than drums/guitar/keyboard" and if you are one of them, this is the section for you, although I would suggest reading the entire document once you have time. 

### Compensation

I'm not poor anymore, but I'm not rich either. I want to compensate everyone who works with me as "fairly" as I can, although I have to be quite honest that I feel like you should be compensated even more "fairly" than the amount of resources I have can provide. **Everyone who performs as a guest musician during one of my sets at any Operation Vesper Loom performance will receive a flat fee of $20 *as a starting point.*** As I explained elsewhere in this document, it's possible that you will receive extra compensation coming from my pay out but I absolutely cannot guarantee that will happen at any particular show. Now that we are clear about how the compensation scheme will work, let's talk about what you're expectations are as a contracted guest musician.

### Expectations

You will be given charts for a small number of songs, possibly even one single song. It's possible that your entire "chart" will consist of only a few bars of music. I love arranging for other instruments and musicians so it's possible I will get carried away, but I'm going to wager that this will not be the most challenging arrangements you've ever had to learn if you are at all competent with your instrument. Most of them will be my original material although I may use guest musicians for certain cover songs as well. Also when I say "charts" I mean any form of written music notation. If you don't "read music" very well, don't worry -- I don't either. I can transcribe your part however you prefer to have it transcribed.

### What To Do Next?

If this all sounds agreeable to you, your next step should be to contact me at `tailglowmusic@proton.me` to let me know what you play, when you expect to be available, and **most importantly** how you want to be contacted. The exact schedule of shows is not lined up yet but I am aiming to book them all between February - May of 2025.

## For Other Musicians/Artists Who Want To Be Involved

Please let me know! If we don't already know each other, feel free to email me at `tailglowmusic@proton.me` and let me know who you are, what you do, and how you can help. This project is very much "my baby" and some of the ambition is quite self-centered: I want to put on really good shows and demonstrate what I'm capable of as a musician. But I also want to demonstrate what "we" are capable of as musicians and even fans of music much more broadly. I'm absolutely open to feedback and collaborative ideas. None of the shows or line ups have been solidified yet so there should be ample opportunity to include those who are enthusiastic.

## Why "Vesper Loom" Though?

*Vespers* is a term from Latin for a liturgical service that takes place at night and focuses on musical devotion. I am not a religious person, but in English it is often translated as "evensong" so the association with live music performances, which generally happen at night, is apt.

A *loom* is a mechanical device used to refine natural fibrous material into "fabric" which can be used for commercial or industrial purposes, which is a process I find interesting in and of itself. The mechanical loom is also directly connected to the advent of modern computation because of the way certain innovations in loom technology allowed for "programmable" patterns based on different "codes" and "inputs" of material. I am also very interested in the history of computation.

I just think words are cool, and interesting words are better than generic words. I wanted a name that is unique enough for branding but also "opaque" enough to generate intrigue. I just didn't want to call it something lame like "Let's Make Music Augusta."
